are becoming increasingly prevalent
<br>
The above problem poses two separate challenges:
<br>
These approaches have limitations
<br>
Capture-replay approaches are tailored to a particular platform's event-dispatching mechanism
<br>
In contrast, model-based approaches are general-purpose, but they can require considerable manual effort
<br>
which has made significant strides in recent years
<br>
We seek to bring the benefits of concolic testing to event- driven programs
<br>
proposing a novel way to alleviate the path-explosion problem tailored to this class of programs
<br>
it is applicable to real programs that often contain parts that are beyond the scope of static analysis.
<br>
Moreover, the condition is inexpensive to check and occurs frequently in real apps, causing the savings to greatly offset the cost of checking it.

<br>
In Android, the widgets on any screen of an app are organized in a tree called the view hierarchy
<br>
propose a radically different approach that is general and fully automatic.
<br>
This not only lets our approach avoid generating spurious events but also enables it to exhaustively generate orthogonal events.
