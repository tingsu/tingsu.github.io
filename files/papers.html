xx are <b>becoming increasingly prevalent</b>.
<br>
The above problem <b>poses two separate challenges</b>:
<br>
These approaches <b>have limitations</b>:
<br>
Capture-replay approaches <b>are tailored to</b> a particular platform's <b>event-dispatching mechanism</b>...
<br>
In contrast, model-based approaches are <b>general-purpose</b>, but they can <b>require considerable manual effort</b>.
<br>
which <b>has made significant strides</b> in recent years
<br>
We <b>seek to bring the benefits</b> of concolic testing <b>to</b> event-driven programs
<br>
propose a novel way to <b>alleviate the path-explosion problem</b> tailored to this class of programs
<br>
it is applicable to real programs that often contain parts that are <b>beyond the scope of static analysis</b>.
<br>
Moreover, the condition is inexpensive to check and occurs frequently in real apps, causing the savings to <b>greatly offset the cost</b> of checking it.
<br>
<b>Source code snippet</b> of music player app
<br>
In Android, the widgets on any screen of an app <b>are organized in</b> a tree called the view hierarchy
<br>
propose <b>a radically different approach</b> that is general and fully automatic.
<br>
This <b>not only lets</b> our approach avoid generating spurious events <b>but also enables</b> it to exhaustively generate orthogonal events.
<br>
<b>threaten the ability to</b> cover all widgets
<br>
a new concrete tap event guaranteed to <b>take the path dictated by this constraint</b> in the view hierarchy
<br>
<b>highlights the complexity</b> for concolic execution that a real platform like Android demands:
<br>
The first time the component is called, it generates a test randomly; <b>thereafter</b>, it inputs tests from either the Concolic testing engine or the Subsumption analyzer.
<br>
<b>Prior research</b> has primarily focused on either unit or GUI testing of Android apps
<br>
EvoDroid <b>overcomes a key shortcoming of</b> using evolutionary techniques for system testing
<br>
identifies the segments of the code <b>amenable to be searched</b> independently
<br>
Our experiments have <b>corroborated</b> EvoDroidâ€™s ability to achieve significantly higher code coverage than existing Android testing tools.
<br>
Small organizations do not have the resources to sufficiently test their products, <b>thereby</b> defective apps are made available to the consumers of these markets.
<br>
<b>The state-of-practice</b> in automated system testing of Android apps is random testing.
<br>
<b>a brute-force mechanism</b>
<br>
reach <b>comparable code coverage</b> as that of Monkey.
<br>
The overall coverage is <b>no better than</b> the initial population (randomly generated tests)
<br>
<b>To that end</b>, it had to overcome the conceptual challenges of using evolutionary techniques for system testing.
<br>
<b>employs</b> a <b>step-wise</b> evolutionary test generation algorithm
<br>
<b>address</b> scalability issues
<br>
The test cases are evaluated based on a fitness function that <b>rewards</b> code coverage and uniqueness of the covered path.
<br>
<b>This has been and continues to be</b> the focus of many research efforts.
<br>
Errors in the GUI can <b>manifest</b> themselves as failures of the overall software.
<br>
To <b>counteract</b> this exponential test suite growth, another approach, and the one used in this paper, is to automatically generate test cases based on usage information,
<br>
employ the profiles to <b>populate a probabilistic model</b> of the GUI application
<br>
the prior probability calculation are extended from single events to sequences of events.
<br>
Alternatively, test cases (i.e., event sequences) can be generated based on <b>concatenating</b> pairs of events that have the highest probability of occurring.
<br>
the Android framework <b>transfers the burden of resource management to</b> the developers
<br>
It is <b>this concept</b> of <b>even-spreading</b> of test cases across the input domain which <b>forms the basic intuition for adaptive random testing</b>.
<br>
when RT has been chosen as <b>a viable testing method</b> for a system, is it worthwhile to use ART instead?
<br>
We decide to deal with effectiveness and efficiency separately in this section
<br>
In other words, different ART algorithms have different effectiveness performance, efficiency performance and characteristics which <b>in turn give rise to</b> different <b>favourable and unfavourable conditions</b> for their applications.
<br>
FSCS-ART <b>is not equivalent to</b> ART which refers to <b>the family of testing methods</b> in which test cases are random and evenly <b>spread across the input domain</b>.
<br>
<b>Obviously</b>, <b>the strengths and weaknesses</b> of a particular ART algorithm for a specific type of software are not necessarily valid nor expected to be similar for other ART algorithms.
<br>
the Fixed-Sized-Candidate-Set ART (<b>hereafter referred to as</b> FSCS-ART)
<br>
<b>An immediate conclusion</b> is that future research <b>shall be focused on</b> either how to use the information of the location of failure-causing input to develop new testing strategies..., or how to ...
<br>
Empirical studies have shown that <b>failure-causing inputs</b> tend to form contiguous failure regions.
<br>
Designing a test suite is widely recognized as a funda- mental activity for effective software testing.
<br>
These questions are especially important for GUIs for a number of reasons. First, ..., Second, ...
<br>
We <b>coined</b> this framework as T+.
<br>
It can <b>flood</b> AUT's GUI with infeasible events.
