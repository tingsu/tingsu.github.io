are becoming increasingly prevalent
<br>
The above problem poses two separate challenges:
<br>
These approaches have limitations
<br>
Capture-replay approaches are tailored to a particular platform's event-dispatching mechanism
<br>
In contrast, model-based approaches are general-purpose, but they can require considerable manual effort
<br>
which has made significant strides in recent years
<br>
We seek to bring the benefits of concolic testing to event- driven programs
<br>
proposing a novel way to alleviate the path-explosion problem tailored to this class of programs
<br>
it is applicable to real programs that often contain parts that are beyond the scope of static analysis.
<br>
Moreover, the condition is inexpensive to check and occurs frequently in real apps, causing the savings to greatly offset the cost of checking it.

<br>
In Android, the widgets on any screen of an app are organized in a tree called the view hierarchy
<br>
propose a radically different approach that is general and fully automatic.
<br>
This not only lets our approach avoid generating spurious events but also enables it to exhaustively generate orthogonal events.
<br>
threaten the ability to cover all widgets
<br>
a new concrete tap event guaranteed to take the path dictated by this constraint in the view hierarchy
<br>
highlights the complexity for concolic execution that a real platform like Android demands:
<br>
The first time the component is called, it generates a test randomly; there- after, it inputs tests from either the Concolic testing engine or the Subsumption analyzer.
<br>
Prior research has primarily focused on either unit or GUI testing of Android apps
<br>
EvoDroid overcomes a key shortcoming of using evolutionary techniques for system testing
<br>
identifies the segments of the code amenable to be searched independently
<br>
Our experi- ments have corroborated EvoDroidâ€™s ability to achieve significantly higher code coverage than existing Android testing tools.
<br>
Small organizations do not have the resources to sufficiently test their products, thereby defective apps are made available to the con- sumers of these markets.
<br>
The state-of-practice in automated system testing of Android apps is random testing.
<br>
a brute-force mechanism
<br>
reach comparable code coverage as that of Monkey.
<br>
The overall coverage is no better than the initial population (randomly generated tests)
<br>
To that end, it had to overcome the concep- tual challenges of using evolutionary techniques for system testing.
<br>
employs a step-wise evolu- tionary test generation algorithm
<br>
address scalability issues
<br>
The test cases are evaluated based on a fitness function that rewards code coverage and uniqueness of the covered path.
<br>
This has been and continues to be the focus of many research efforts.
