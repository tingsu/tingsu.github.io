        <h1>Towards Efficient Data-flow Test Generation</h1>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>Data-flow testing (DFT) aims to check the correctness of variable definitions by observing their corresponding uses. In contrast to control-flow coverage criteria (e.g., statement, branch coverage), data-flow coverage criteria focus on the flow of data. Several empirical studies have demonstrated data-flow testing is more effective in fault detection than control-flow testing, however, the complexities of DFT still overwhelm the testers and prevent DFT from finding its adoption in practice. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a hybrid testing framework, which synergistically combines two state-of-the-art techniques, i.e., symbolic execution (SE) and model checking. Symbolic execution is guided to efficiently search for program paths to cover data-flow test objectives, and then the problem of DFT is casted into reachability checking via software model checking to complement SE. This yields a practical DFT testing technique that combines the two approaches’ strengths. We implemented our technique on state-of-the-art symbolic execution tool KLEE and model checking tools BLAST, CPAchecker and CBMC, and extensively evaluate it on 30 real-world subjects with collectively 22,793 def-use pairs. Compared with state-of-the-arts, the enhanced symbolic execution approach can not only cover more pairs, but also reudce testing time by 10~43% and number of explored paths by 13~69%. The model checking approach can effectively weed out infeasible pairs that KLEE cannot tell by 70.1 ∼ 95.8%. As a result, the hybrid approach can improve data-flow coverage by 28.7~46.3%, and reduce testing time by up to 64.6% for all subjects than symbolic execution approach alone. This hybrid approach also enables cross-checking of each component for reliable and robust testing results.</p>
        
        <p>See this <a href="http://tingsu.github.io/files/data-flow-testing-survey.pdf">survey</a> for details about data flow testing techniques.</p>
        
        <p>Various approaches have been used to automate data flow testing, for example the following approaches have been used in data flow-based test generation:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><i>Random Testing</i>: random or adaptive random test generation.</li>
            <li><i>Collateral Coverage-based Testing</i>: exploit the subsumption relation between test objectives to reduce testing cost and infer coverage.</li>
            <li><i>Search-based Testing</i>: search algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithms, optimization algorithms) are used guided by a fitness function to sastify test objectives.</li>
            <li><i>Symbolic Execution-based Testing</i>: it includes traditional (i.e. static) symbolic execution and dynamic symbolic execution.</li>
            <li><i>Model Checking-based Testing</i>: a verfication-based testing method used to generate conterexamples as tests.</li>
        </ul>
