\section{RESEARCH\\INTERESTS}
{My research interests mainly involve software engineering, programming language, and security. I am particularly interested in developing novel program analysis, testing and verification techniques to improve software quality, reliability and security, and developer productivity. 
In my research, I devote myself to convert these techniques into practical tools (not just prototypes), and benefit both academia and industry.
Currently, my work tests and verifies different types of software, e.g., mobile applications, embedded software, program compilers/analyzers, deep learning systems, etc. 
My PhD thesis tackles the problem of automated coverage criteria driven test data generation to improve software testing. In the thesis, I developed the coverage-driven test data generation techniques from three perspectives, i.e., control-flow coverage, data-flow coverage, and model coverage for embedded and GUI software. Currently, I am looking into the problem of test oracles for testing GUI software, compilers, and program analyzers.}

\section{PROJECTS}
\normalfont{\textbf{Mobile App Analysis, Testing and Security\hfill{2015 - now}}}\\
I lead several research work on analyzing, testing, debugging, and securing mobile applications. The \emph{key goal} is to sharpen the competitive edge of mobile apps, and ensure their reliability and security.
In particular, I spent two years and developed a state-of-the-art GUI testing tool \emph{\textbf{Stoat}} (\url{https://tingsu.github.io/files/stoat.html}) for Android apps.
Stoat has been deployed to extensively test \underline{9,000+} open-source and commercial apps and found \underline{8,000+} fatal crashes in one year. Stoat has contributed to such popular apps as \texttt{WeChat}, \texttt{Google+}, \texttt{Gmail} that have billions of users. Stoat won the \emph{First Place of ACM Student Research Competition} in ICSE 2016, \emph{First Place of Research Tool Competition} in NASAC 2017, and received \emph{NTUitive Gap Fund Grant} in 2018 for start-up commercialization. Stoat was recognized as ``\emph{a state-of-the-art tool, (which) is able to trigger the highest number of unique crashes (in Android apps)}'' by a recent study from the research group of IEEE Fellow Prof. Tao Xie. Stoat has also been widely used by the researchers from many renowned institutes worldwide, e.g., UIUC, UC Irvine, ETH Zurich, Peking University, Nanjing University. See the demo of Stoat testing platform: \url{https://youtu.be/41jzFM7WhP4}

I also lead the first, largest and most comprehensive fault study for Android apps (\url{https://crashanalysis.github.io/}), based on the bugs detected by Stoat and the data from open-source hosting platforms (e.g., \texttt{Github}, \texttt{Google Code}). This study involves \underline{2,486} open-source apps, \underline{3,230} commercial apps, and \underline{135} professional app developers worldwide. We investigate the key question ``\emph{why an Android app may crash?}'', understand how app developers analyze, test, reproduce and fix app crashes, and motivate several follow-up research directions. This work won an \emph{ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award} in ICSE 2018. Our dataset and benchmark have been requested by more than 13 institutes worldwide (e.g., CMU, UNSW, Monash, HKUST). Following this study, we designed more effective testing techniques (Stoat+ and APEChecker) for detecting intricate bug types (e.g., asynchronous programming errors).

We also conducted a large-scale automated security risk assessment for mobile banking apps. This study revealed \underline{2,157} security weaknesses in \underline{693} banking apps worldwide. To date, \underline{21} banking entities have confirmed \underline{126} weaknesses, and \underline{52} weaknesses have been patched. This work has been well-acknowledged by some bank entities from HonKong, Singapore and India, e.g., \texttt{HSBC}, \texttt{OCBC}, \texttt{DBS} and \texttt{BHIM}. The tool \textbf{Ausera} won \emph{Third Place of Research Tool Competition} in NASAC 2018, and now has been integrated into one security scanning product of \href{https://scantist.com/}{\texttt{Scantist}}. 

\normalfont{\textbf{Automatic Test Data Generation for Embedded Software \hfill{2014 - now}}}\\
Since my Ph.D., I continuously lead the research work on leveraging \emph{dynamic symbolic execution} techniques to automatically generate test data for industrial embedded software. The \emph{key goal} is to reduce human testing efforts and detect functional bugs as early as possible (especially at the unit testing stage).
I developed and maintained an academic research tool \textbf{\emph{CAUT}} that automatically generates test data to satisfy different testing adequacy criteria. Later, as a co-founder, I significantly contributed to \textbf{\emph{\href{http://180.167.177.62:1111}{SmartUnit}}}, a commercial automated unit testing tool inspired by CAUT. SmartUnit fully supports unit testing for statement, branch, boundary value and MC/DC coverage, and has been applied in several \underline{industry-scale} embedded control systems, and accumulatively tested \underline{millions lines} of C code.  
It is now serving more than ten Chinese industrial companies, including \texttt{CASCO} (the best railway signal
corporation in China), \texttt{GAC MOTOR} (one of biggest car manufacturers in China), \texttt{CAST} (the main spacecraft production agency in China). 

\normalfont{\textbf{Testing Compilers and Program Analyzers \hfill{2015 - now}}}\\
I also worked on testing compilers (e.g., Java Virtual Machines) and program analyzers (e.g., software model checkers, SAT/SMT solvers). The \emph{key goal} is to ensure the correctness and reliability of many fundamental development tools we very depend on.
We proposed two stress-testing techniques \emph{\textbf{classming}} and \emph{\textbf{classfuzz}} for JVMs. We discovered \underline{62+} JVM discrepancies in the start-up process of \texttt{Oracle}'s HotSpot and \texttt{IBM}'s J9, which lead to  several clarifications and changes to the Java SE 8 edition of the JVM specification; We revealed \underline{30+} fatal bugs in \texttt{Oracle}'s HotSpot and \texttt{IBM}'s J9. In particular, we found one highly-critical security vulnerability (CVE-2017-1376, CVSS base score \underline{9.8}), which directly affects \underline{6} IBM's products and \underline{99} IBM's derivative products.

To validate the correctness of software model checkers (the implementations of a well-known automatic program verification technique), we proposed an effective testing technique \textbf{\emph{\href{https://github.com/MCFuzzer/MCFuzz}{MCFuzz}}}. MCFuzz has extensively tested three state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice C software model checkers, \texttt{CPAchecker}, \texttt{CBMC}, and \texttt{SeaHorn}. We have found bugs in all
three model checkers. To date, we have reported a total of \underline{62} unique bugs --- \underline{59} were previously unknown, \underline{58} have been confirmed, and \underline{20} have been fixed. We are well-appreciated by the model checker developers.

\normalfont{\textbf{Business Process Model Mining and Validation \hfill{2017 - 2018}}}\\
At the Rolls-Royce research lab, I worked on developing an automated business process model translation and mining tool chain to validate the correctness of in-house business process, especially for the airplane engine development process.  

\normalfont{\textbf{Setting Exploration Automation \hfill{2015}}}\\
At Synopsys, I worked on developing a distributed testing framework to efficiently generate optimal parameter configurations for Synopsys's in-house hardware verification tools. This project was recognized as \emph{an innovation project} in Synopsys.
